# Introduction #

Listed here will be the various formulas for calculating fuel efficiency

## Knowns ##

These knowns will be referenced in the formulas

  * V = current velocity of the car
  * Î”V = Change in velocity, acceleration, of the car
  * HW = EPA rated highway mileage of the car
  * CY = EPA rated city milage of the car
  * CCH = EPA rated combined city highway milage of the car
  * EFF = Efficiency of the car, usually in Miles per gallon

## Formula based on speed ##

example formula
```
EFF = V * CCH
```
